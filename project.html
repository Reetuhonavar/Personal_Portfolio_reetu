				<h6>Crop Data Analysis</h6>
				<p class="cropin">"Crop Data Analysis" system handles crop growth. Proposed system helps to take decision by prediction and its analysis on data acquired and collected from agriculture sector using machine learning. The crop data analysis system contains datasets which contains the crop prices, production, area in a different years and district etc. By analyzing this data, system gives the result of Area under harvesting by district, Production of crops by district, Production rate and area analysis, Crop prices variation, Prices of major crops year wise, Area under cultivation of major crops year wise, Amount of production of major crops year wise all this in a graphical representation.</p>
